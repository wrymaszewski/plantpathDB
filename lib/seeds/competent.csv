Tunable expression is achieved by varying the level of lysozyme (lysY), the natural inhibitor of T7 RNA polymerase. The level of lysozyme is modulated by adding L-rhamnose to the expression culture at levels from zero to 2000 µM. When Lemo21(DE3) is grown without rhamnose, the strain performs the same as a pLysS containing strain. However, optional addition of rhamnose tunes the expression of the protein of interest.
